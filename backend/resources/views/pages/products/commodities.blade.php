                        <h2>Commodities</h2>
                        <p>So first of all the question arises - What are commodities? In economics, a Commodity is a marketable item produced to satisfy wants or needs. In other words commodity is a raw material or primary agricultural product that can be bought and sold, such as copper or coffee. Now the next question - What are Commodity Markets? So the answer is any place where all raw or primary products are exchanged is called commodity market. Commodity markets can include direct physical trading and derivatives trading in the form of spot prices, forwards, futures and options. Commodity Futures are contracts to buy/sell specific quantity of a particular commodity at a future date on an exchange platform . It is similar to the Index futures and Stock futures but the underlying happens to be commodities instead of Stocks and indices.</p>

                                <h3>Basic Instruction (How to Trade)</h3>
                                <p>The basic information that should be with the client is as follows:- The process of the selection of the commodity depends on the knowledge and interest of the client regarding various commodities. It also depends on the amount of margin money means how much the client is interested to invest in commodity market. The selection of the commodity also depends on the time horizon (short, medium and long) for which the customer wants to go for investment in commodities. The choice of commodities is also based on the purpose for which customer want to go for investment like hedging, speculation or diversification. Margin amount has to be deposited by both buyers and sellers of futures contracts through cheque. The purpose of collecting margin money by the exchange is to avoid the counter party risk of defaulting by its members or their clients in fulfilling their obligations. It is a part of the risk management system. For conducting the process of trading the client can contact the dealer for knowing the price, movement and details regarding the amount required for doing a trade. For information on a particular commodity one has to generate interest in reading the fundamental reports coming out from the research desk. The profit and loss of a trade depends on how correct you can identify the future trend of the price movement of that particular commodity. The loss can be controlled by putting a stop loss whenever you trade.</p>
